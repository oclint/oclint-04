OCLint is a [static source code analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis) tool for improving quality and reducing defects by inspecting Objective-C/C++/C code and looking for potential problems like:

* Possible bugs - empty if/else/try/catch/finally statements
* Unused code - unused local variables and parameters
* Complicated code - high cyclomatic complexity and NPath complexity
* Code smells - long method, long parameter list, redundant code
* ...

Currently, it is a standalone tool that runs on 64-bit Intel Mac OS X 10.6+, and could be invoked from command line. Read more from [gh-pages](http://longyiqi.github.com/mo).
